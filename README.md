# Email-Spam-Filtering
Introduction
Our Email Spam Filtering system is designed to identify and filter out spam emails, ensuring that only legitimate emails reach users' inboxes. It leverages advanced machine learning techniques and rule-based algorithms to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between spam and non-spam emails.

Components
1. Machine Learning Model
Our system employs a machine learning model trained on a diverse dataset of spam and non-spam emails. The model continuously learns and adapts to new patterns, improving its accuracy over time.

2. Rule-Based Filters
In addition to the machine learning model, we have implemented rule-based filters to catch specific characteristics commonly found in spam emails. These filters add an extra layer of protection and help minimize false positives.
